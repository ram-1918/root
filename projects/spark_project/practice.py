Self-introduction:
Hi this is Ram Chandra Bhavirisetty, I recently graduated from University at Buffalo with my majors in data science. Coming to my academic projects, I have worked in group projects in my masters on House Price Prediction and Reinforcement learning.
UG - CSE
Projects - Web applications(Front end), MP3 player
Coding Competitions - Hackathons
Work-experience - (Feb - Aug) 1.5 yr
Masters - Data science ->
UG - Ml workshop - few hours - excitement - enthusiasm - new tech learn - research - can do more with Ml- so - decide- masters - Alternate Career - don't stick
Ultimate interest - Full stack/ sde
Projects - ML projects(Algos), Data mining(Shiny tool)
Personal project - This project has a major role in academic career


Data science is an exciting and rapidly growing field that offers tremendous career opportunities for those with the right skills. As a data scientist, I can use my analytical thinking to identify trends and patterns in large datasets, allowing me to draw meaningful insights from complex information. With this knowledge, I can help organizations make more informed decisions about their operations and strategies. Additionally, data scientists are increasingly being called upon to develop predictive models that anticipate future events or outcomes based on historical evidence – a skill which has become invaluable in today’s competitive business landscape.

The need for professionals who understand how to effectively analyze big data sets is only expected to grow over time as more companies look towards leveraging the power of technology-driven decision making processes such as machine learning algorithms or artificial intelligence systems into their operations. Moreover, many businesses now recognize the importance of having someone on staff who understands not just how these tools work but also what they mean for their organization's bottom line; thus creating even greater demand for experienced practitioners like myself within this space .

In conclusion ,data science provides me with an opportunity not only stay ahead of emerging trends but also contribute meaningfully towards helping organizations achieve success through intelligent utilization of resources . It is no wonder then why so many people have chosen it as a viable career path - one which promises both job security along with immense potential growth prospects!
